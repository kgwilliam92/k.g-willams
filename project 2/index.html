      The Lord is my light and salvation;
      whom shall i fear?
      The Lord is the strength of my life;
      Of whom shall i be afraid?
      When the wicked came against me 
      To eat up flesh,
      My enemies and foes, 
      They stumbled and fell.
      Though war may rise against me,
      My heart shall not fear;
      Though war may rise against me, 
      In this I will be confident.

      One thing i have desired of th Lord,
      That will i seek:
      That I may dwell in the house of the Lord 
      All the days of my life
      To behold nthe beauty of the Lord,
      And to inquire in his temple.
      For in the time of trouble 
      He shall hide me in His pavilion
      In the secret place of His tabernacle
      He shall hide me;
      He shall set me high upon a rock.

      And now my head shall be lifted up above 
        my enemies all around me;
      Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle 
      I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the lord  

      Hear, O Lord, when i cry with my voice!
      Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
      When you said,"Seek My Face"
      My heart said to you, "your face, Lord, I will seek."
      Do not hide Your face from me;
      Do not turn your servant away in anger;
      you have been my help;
      do not leave me nor forsake me,
      O God of my salvation.
      When my father and my mother forsake me,
      Then the Lord Will take care of me.

      Teach me Your way O Lord, 
      And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.
      Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries;
      For false witnesses have risen against me,
      And such as breathe out violence.
      I would have lost heart unless I had believed
      That I would see the goodness of the LORD
      In the land of the living 

      Wait on the LORD;
      Be of good courage,
      And He shall Strengthen your heart;
      Wait,I say , on the LORD!

<p>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.

Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.

He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;

Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.

Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;

There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

<p> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.

Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.

There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.

Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.

Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.

Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.</p>
